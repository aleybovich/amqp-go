# AMQP-Go Server

A lightweight, pure Go implementation of the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol, designed for simulations, testing, and development environments.

## Overview

This project implements the core functionality of the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol (the protocol used by RabbitMQ and other message brokers) in Go. It provides a server that speaks the AMQP protocol, allowing client applications to connect and use standard AMQP libraries such as `amqp091-go` to interact with it.

## Features

- **Protocol Compliance**: Implements key parts of the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol
- **Exchange Types**: Supports direct exchange type
- **Queue Operations**: Create queues, bind to exchanges, and consume messages
- **Messaging**: Publish and consume messages with routing keys
- **Connection Management**: Handles AMQP connections, channels, and heartbeats
- **Colorized Logging**: Detailed, readable logs with syntax highlighting
- **Custom Logging**: Pluggable logger interface for integration with external logging systems
- **Connection Cleanup**: Proper resource cleanup when connections are closed
- **Heartbeat Support**: Handles client heartbeats for connection health monitoring
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Supports standard AMQP connection closure protocol

## Implemented AMQP Operations

- **Connection**: `start`, `start-ok`, `tune`, `tune-ok`, `open`, `open-ok`, `close`, `close-ok`
- **Channel**: `open`, `open-ok`, `close`, `close-ok`
- **Exchange**: `declare`, `declare-ok`
- **Queue**: `declare`, `declare-ok`, `bind`, `bind-ok`
- **Basic**: `publish`, `consume`, `consume-ok`, `deliver`

## Usage

### Running the Server

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    server := NewServer()
    if err := server.Start(":5672"); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to start server: %v", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}
```

### Connecting with an AMQP Client

```go
import (
    amqp "github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go"
)

// Connect to the server
conn, err := amqp.Dial("amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to connect: %v", err)
}
defer conn.Close()

// Create a channel
ch, err := conn.Channel()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to open channel: %v", err)
}
defer ch.Close()

// Declare an exchange
err = ch.ExchangeDeclare(
    "my-exchange", // name
    "direct",      // type
    false,         // durable
    false,         // auto-deleted
    false,         // internal
    false,         // no-wait
    nil,           // arguments
)
```

## Custom Logging Integration

The server supports pluggable logging through the `Logger` interface:

```go
// Create a server with custom logger
myLogger := NewCustomLogger() // Implementing the Logger interface
server := NewServer(WithLogger(myLogger))
```

### Logger Interface

```go
type Logger interface {
    Fatal(format string, a ...any)
    Err(format string, a ...any)
    Warn(format string, a ...any)
    Info(format string, a ...any)
    Debug(format string, a ...any)
}
```

## Default Logging

The server includes detailed logging with color support to make it easier to track AMQP operations:
- ðŸŸ¢ [INFO] - Standard operational messages
- ðŸŸ¡ [WARN] - Warning conditions
- ðŸ”´ [ERROR] - Error conditions

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests demonstrating the server capabilities:

```bash
# Run all tests
go test -v

# Run a specific test
go test -v -run TestServerPublishConsume
```

## Limitations

This implementation is designed for simulation and development purposes:
- No persistence (all data is in-memory)
- Limited exchange types (currently only direct exchanges are supported)
- Basic security (default credentials only)
- No clustering or high availability features

## Development Status

This is an educational project/work in progress. Not intended for production use.
